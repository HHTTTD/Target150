          <h4>PROCESSING AND STORAGE</h4>
          <h3>World-class Facilities for Premium Healthcare</h3>
          <p>To maintain our position at the forefront of medical science and world-class healthcare, we have made every effort to keep our equipment and facilities at the highest standard possible.</p>
          <p>Our laboratory is equipped with an ISO Class 7 cleanroom – with constantly monitored pressure, humidity and temperature. Our laboratory also features automated equipment to isolate and preserve stem cells (with a cell recovery rate of 99% – highest in the industry) and an advanced lab information system removing human error from the process.</p>
          <p>Our cryopreservation system uses vaporized nitrogen preventing cross-contamination or exposure to disease. This technique is certified under the European Union’s Medical Device Directive. Our storage bunker is also fully fireproof with solid concrete walls, a reinforced ceiling, and an access-controlled 30cm thick steel door for added protection.</p>

          <h4>TRANSPORTING YOUR STEM CELLS</h4>
          <h3>Quick and Safe</h3>
          <p>We have established an efficient transport system that maintains storage quality without compromising delivery speed for prompt and professional withdrawal and deposit of your stem cells. There is no added cost for the retrieval of your cells and deposits are made simple through ready-made collection kits that your chosen medical professional can use to gather the required tissue.</p>
          <p>We use a Cryogenic Vapour Shipper for stem cell transfers. This technology of dry, spill-free vapour-phase shipping is implemented to keep your stem cells safe, healthy, and ready for your physician’s use. The Cryogenic Vapour Shipper ships your stem cells with a “non-hazardous” classification throughout the world, reducing costs while assuring sample viability.</p>
