            <h3>What are amniotic fluid stem cells?</h3>
            <p>Amniotic Fluid Stem Cells (AFS) are stem cells extracted from the amniotic fluid, the liquid surrounding a fetus during pregnancy. These cells have the ability to divide and develop into various types of cells in the body, including muscle, bone, and nerve cells.</p>
            <p>AFS possess unique properties that aid in the regeneration and repair of damaged tissues in the body, making them highly valuable in medical and research fields. Their diverse capabilities in tissue development and repair present significant potential for treating diseases and conditions related to tissue degeneration, such as osteoarthritis, heart disease, and nerve injuries.
                Importantly, AFS also contributes to body rejuvenation, thus improving patients' physical performance and quality of life.</p>
