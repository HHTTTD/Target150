          <h4 class="subheading">Painless. Safe. Effortless.</h4>
          <p>Target150 works with internationally accredited, patented technology to meet your every stem cell need. With experts in the field of stem cell extraction and processing, we guarantee every procedure is painless, scarless, and entirely safe.</p>
          <p>At Target150, we are able to offer stem cell services for people of all ages because we focus on the collection of two types of stem cells: the haematopoietic (HSCs) – found in the umbilical cord – and the mesenchymal (MSCs), which are retrieved from the placenta after birth or from excess adipose (fat) tissue, which can be collected at any age.</p>
          <p>HSCs are used to develop blood cells and can therefore be used to treat blood disorders and help with immunity problems. They cannot be multiplied, however, making the umbilical cord a rare source of these lifesaving stem cells.</p>
          <p>MSCs can specialize into any number of cell types and can be multiplied. These stem cells are key in the treatment of hundreds of disorders, and can even be used for restorative or cosmetic procedures.</p>

          <h4>Invest in your future health</h4>
          <p>Modern healthcare has made great strides in providing safe, chemical-free alternative treatment options. Stem cells, once only available through placenta and umbilical cord, are now an option for adults by extracting unwanted fat deposits in the body – a tissue which, in high levels, can increase the risk of diabetes and heart disease.</p>
          <h4>Using fat tissue</h4>
          <p>Adipose tissue, more commonly known as fat tissue, is found beneath the skin, around internal organs, in bones and the breast tissue. Adipose tissue is a rich source of MSCs.</p>
          <p>Target150 works with a painless, scar-free patented technology to extract stem cells which can be used for medical and restorative therapies.</p>

        <div class="card-body">
          <h4>Give your child the gift of a better life</h4>
          <p>We have collection kits for gathering stem cells during both vaginal and caesarean baby deliveries. Both haematopoietic and mesenchymal stem cells are harvestable during delivery making it a critical moment to invest in the health of your child.</p>
          <h4>Using cord blood</h4>
          <p>The blood that remains in the umbilical cord and placenta is usually discarded after delivery however that cord blood is rich in haematopoietic stem cells. The process of extraction poses no risk to either the newborn or mother as the HSCs are taken from the cord once it has been clamped and cut.</p>
          <p>Cord blood stem cells are only collectable immediately after the baby's birth. Arrangements for collection will need to be made in advance. <a href="../pages/contact.html">Please contact us to find out our areas of service and how we work with your healthcare provider for collection.</a></p>

          <h4>Using placenta and cord tissue</h4>
          <p>Inside both the placenta and the umbilical cord is a gelatinous substance called Wharton's jelly - rich in MSCs. The placenta and cord tissue are easily collected after delivery and pose no risk or threat of pain for either the baby or the mother. This type of donation is only possible during delivery. Arrangements for collection will need to be made in advance.  <a href="../pages/contact.html">Please contact us to find out our areas of service and how we work with your healthcare provider for collection.</a></p>
