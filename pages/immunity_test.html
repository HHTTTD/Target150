          <p>Medical tests can measure NK Cell Count and NK Activity through a blood test, assessing an individual’s ability to destroy viruses and cancer cells. Therefore, those who benefit the most from this test are those with low immune levels, as well as healthy individuals who wish to monitor their innate immune system’s function.</p>

          <p>This technology is called ‘Highly Active NK Cell Therapy,’ which is a technology that helps boost the immune system to a better level by increasing the number of NK cells that have been strengthened. This is done by taking the patient’s blood, culturing it to increase the NK cell count, and then reintroducing these enhanced cells back into the body. This process helps prevent and treat cancer as well as infectious diseases. At the same time, if NK cell levels are already high, it is still beneficial to maintain this level to preserve the strength of the immune system, ensuring the body is always ready to face various diseases.</p>

          <p>The interpretation of NK cell strength is a cutting-edge and innovative technology currently being used in medical treatments and various research fields. Therefore, the recommendation for this treatment should come from a medical professional who is an expert in this technology and has continuously studied modern research. <strong><a href="../pages/contact.html">For latest NK cell technology services, please contact us.</a></strong></p>
