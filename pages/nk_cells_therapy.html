          <h3>Get to know modern innovations in killing cancer cells and cells infected with viruses.</h3>
          <p>Recent advancements in medicine have allowed us to effectively measure NK cells, helping us determine both the remaining count (NK Count) and the activity (NK Activity) of NK cells with precision. This provides insight into the body’s future immune strength before disease onset and enables early disease prevention planning.</p>
          <p>As mentioned above, NK Cells (Natural Killer Cells) are a type of white blood cell found in the bloodstream and are part of the body’s innate immune system. They act like the body’s defense army, protecting and eliminating foreign invaders, pathogens, viruses, and even cancer cells threatening our health. Unlike other white blood cells, NK cells do not need to recognize specific characteristics of foreign invaders to act. This gives NK cells a higher ability to destroy cancer cells compared to other white blood cells.</p>
          <p>The function of NK cells helps assess the body’s ability to fight harmful foreign agents and evaluates the strength of your immune system in combating infections or cancer cells. Testing the potential of NK cells is therefore essential.</p>
          <p>Under normal conditions, the effectiveness of NK cell function can decrease due to body weakness, often caused by aging, which is linked to an increased risk of cancer. Other factors, such as poor diet (low in protein), lack of sleep, excessive alcohol consumption, frequent smoking, and recurrent infections like herpes, shingles, and hepatitis, can also contribute to a decline in NK cell function.</p>
          <p>Medical tests can measure NK Cell Count and NK Activity through a blood test, assessing an individual's ability to destroy viruses and cancer cells. Therefore, those who benefit the most from this test are those with low immune levels, as well as healthy individuals who wish to monitor their innate immune system’s function.</p>

          <p>However, if the NK cell activity level is found to be lower than average, it is possible to boost the NK cells back to optimal levels. With the current advancements in medicine, modern innovations have introduced technologies for culturing and expanding NK cells in the laboratory or processes for isolating NK cells from normal blood. These cells are then cultured in internationally recognized laboratory standards, resulting in NK cells that have been enhanced for maximum efficacy before being injected back into the patient. This process strengthens and improves the immune system, making it more effective. As the immune system becomes stronger, the body is better able to prevent infections from foreign pathogens and reduce the risk of cancer. Furthermore, the efficacy of treating degenerative diseases and chronic conditions also improves. The function of NK cells helps assess the body's ability to fight harmful foreign agents and evaluates the strength of your immune system in combating infections or cancer cells. Testing the potential of NK cells is therefore essential.</p>
          <p>This technology is called 'Highly Active NK Cell Therapy,' which is a technology that helps boost the immune system to a better level by increasing the number of NK cells that have been strengthened. This is done by taking the patient's blood, culturing it to increase the NK cell count, and then reintroducing these enhanced cells back into the body. This process helps prevent and treat cancer as well as infectious diseases. At the same time, if NK cell levels are already high, it is still beneficial to maintain this level to preserve the strength of the immune system, ensuring the body is always ready to face various diseases.</p>
          <p>The interpretation of NK cell strength is a cutting-edge and innovative technology currently being used in medical treatments and various research fields. Therefore, the recommendation for this treatment should come from a medical professional who is an expert in this technology and has continuously studied modern research.  <strong><a href="../pages/contact.html">For latest NK cell technology services, please contact us.</a></strong></p>
